# Reinforcement Learning Agent for Monopoly

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for my master thesis project focused on developing a reinforcement learning (RL) agent capable of playing the Monopoly board game.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to design and implement an RL agent that can effectively learn to play Monopoly, a complex and strategic board game involving various aspects such as property acquisition, rent collection, and decision-making.

## Repository Structure

- `Monopoly/`: Contains the source code for the RL agent implementation.
- `LICENSE`: License file for the repository.
- `README.md`: This README file providing an overview of the project.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- OpenAI Gym (for environment simulation)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/monopoly-rl-agent.git
   ```


## Usage

1. Navigate to the `src/` directory:

   ```bash
   cd Monopoly
   ```

2. Run the main script to train the RL agent:

   ```bash
   gamePlay.ipynb
   ```
